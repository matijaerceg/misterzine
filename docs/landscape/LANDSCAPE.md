# The MiSTer Hardware Landscape — data spec

This folder is the third misterzine channel: a hand-curated map of every way to
own a MiSTer. Nothing here is scraped or automated. Updates happen in normal
Claude sessions by editing `hardware.json` only; the page (`index.html` in
this folder, one self-contained vanilla-JS file like the other two surfaces)
renders entirely from that file, so adding/editing hardware never touches
layout code. The interview questions also live in `hardware.json` (an
`interview` key: answers carry `require` any-of token groups, `effort`
allowlists, or a `budget` cap), and options carry an `effort` grade
(`none | some | diy`) the build question filters on.

Nav name: **Landscape**. Page title: "The MiSTer FPGA Hardware Landscape" (user added FPGA 2026-07-16). Header: MiSTerZine wordmark top-left links home; the freshness chip (meta.updated) IS the whole subtitle (scope sentence removed, user ruling 2026-07-16); pills + theme toggle stay pinned top-right at every width; the zero state shows no fit-count line.
URL: `/landscape/`. Outward copy may say "landscape" or "hardware matrix" —
never "release tracker" (that term belongs to the releases page).

## Page structure (restructured 2026-07-16, user's design)

Four lanes: **Consoles** (custom-shell machines, "starting at" pricing,
variants in the panel) - **Ready-built kits** (standard modular stack,
assembled; checkmark-or-priced-add-on per answered question) - **Do It
Yourself** (rendered as COLUMNS: Mainboards | I/O boards | USB | Adapters -
the columns ARE the anatomy lesson; parts carry `category: io|hub|adapter`
and get their own small sheets at `#p-<id>`; answers HIGHLIGHT the parts a
build would use; each mainboard card carries a "+ 128MB RAM stick" line,
no RAM column) - **On the horizon**. The Special builds lane is GONE:
ironclad-dx and mistercade-lite are IO-column parts now (the JAMMA/cab
answer resolves as a parts chain), multisystem1 lives in Consoles as a
discontinued row. Once any answer exists, entries that do not fit collapse
to slim reasoned rows in every lane (gray-never-hide, evolved). No
clickable configurator - configurations are IMPLIED educationally (user
ruling; revisit only if he asks).

**Vendor exclusion (user, personal, 2026-07-16): Antonio Villena products
are NOT listed anywhere on the landscape. Do not add them on any sweep.**

## Design doctrine (agreed 2026-07-16, do not silently reverse)

- The unit is a **purchasable starting point**, not a chip. A bare MiSTer Pi
  and a kit containing one are different options in different lanes.
- Lanes = **assembly effort** (turnkey -> kit -> DIY -> special -> horizon).
  Display type, Y/C, SNAC, budget are cross-cutting filters, never lanes.
- Zero state is **neutral fact only** — no badges, no opinions. Opinion
  (verdicts, "most popular") appears only downstream of visitor answers.
- Complete-setup price is fact, not opinion: computed as option price plus
  its `to_complete` parts. Sticker price alone is a half-truth; never show it
  without the complete figure.
- Capabilities are **paths, not booleans**. "Y/C out" resolves to
  built-in / possible-with-listed-parts(+cost) / no-path. Never a bare check.
- Filtered-out options are **grayed with a stated reason**, never hidden.
- Every fact cell carries a `verified: YYYY-MM` stamp. Prefer "unverified"
  over marketing claims. No live prices — typical USD street, revisited on
  quarterly sweeps.
- `status: announced` items render visibly non-orderable. Discontinued items
  stay in the file with `status: discontinued` (spatial permanence).

## User taste rulings (2026-07-16 review round - do not silently reverse)

- **No Permanent Marker on this page.** Titles are Roboto Condensed 700
  (`.cd`), body is Roboto. (Marker stays a zine/releases brand element.)
- **No budget question.** Price is visible on every card and guides the
  verdict ranking; it is not a filter. Rejected as a main filter by the user.
- **No per-question microcopy.** Questions stand alone; the `why` field was
  removed from the interview schema.
- **Option names include the maker** the way people say them ("MiSTer Addons
  Skeleton Kit"); cards show no separate vendor line (the sheet keeps the
  `vendor` field).
- **Display question is multi-select** (labels: HDMI / RGB - Component /
  S-Video - Composite); every selected output must be satisfiable.
- **Availability is a factor**: options carry `stock`
  (`now | waves | scarce | na`) rendered as a card line, plus a
  single-toggle "Want it soon?" question (ONE checkbox-style answer, user
  ruling 2026-07-16) requiring `now`. Stock drifts fast - re-verify on
  every sweep.
- **Dead ends are loud**: any answer that leaves zero fits shows a warning
  verdict box IMMEDIATELY (whatever the answer count), naming horizon items
  that would fit ("It exists, but only on the horizon: ...").
- **Announced items get slim rows**, not full cards (horizon lane renders
  compact); status tags sit in the card flow, never overlapping the name.
- **Lane zoom is animated** (FLIP, transform-only, ~220ms, no rotation, runs
  under prefers-reduced-motion per the site's standing rationale); the sheet
  gets a 150ms fade/scale-in. Verified by sampling transforms per frame.
- **Discontinued/cancelled items never render "price TBA"**: `price_usd` on
  a dead product means its last known price, shown as "was $X"; null hides
  the price line entirely (user ruling 2026-07-16).
- **Open-source-only hardware stays within existing lanes, no new lane**:
  Multisystem1 (discontinued as a product, buildable from open files) lives
  in special builds with its story in the notes. A dedicated "open-source
  DIY fabrication" lane was considered and scoped out 2026-07-16 - the
  audience is overwhelmed newcomers, not PCB fabricators; revisit only if
  several such entries accumulate.
- **MiSTer Pi bundle tiers are NOT separate cards** (ruling 2026-07-16):
  bundles of the same board + parts you still assemble are price points of
  one starting point, listed in the option's notes. Contrast: a factory-
  ASSEMBLED build (qmtech-assembled) is its own kits-lane card because the
  effort grade differs.
- Options carry `img: "<option-id>.png"` pointing into docs/landscape/img/.
  The user sources the images himself (alpha-transparent PNGs, ~160px on the
  long side is plenty; card slot renders 52px contain-fit). A missing file
  self-removes and is remembered (NOPIC) so re-renders fire no repeat 404s -
  dropping a correctly named PNG into the folder is the entire workflow, no
  code or data change.

## Page UX (agreed 2026-07-16, before any page code exists)

The page mimics an expert being asked "which MiSTer should I buy": the
poster is the expert's mental map, the interview prunes it.

- **Poster**: all lanes visible at once. Semantic zoom in DISCRETE levels
  (landscape -> lane -> card spec sheet), never continuous free pan/zoom.
  Each zoom level is a legible, linkable layout. Transitions must work as
  instant cuts (user's OS runs prefers-reduced-motion).
- **Interview**: persistent side rail on desktop, questions answerable in
  any order, each with an "I don't know" that never prunes, plus microcopy
  on why the question matters. Mobile: rail collapses to sticky removable
  chips ("CRT - S-video x") over a vertical lane scroll.
- **Pruning**: gray, never hide or shrink; every grayed card carries its
  rule-out reason. Spatial permanence: the landscape never rearranges.
- **Verdict**: top pick + runner-up + one-line why, rendered only after
  ~3 answered questions. Before that, only a neutral count survives.
- **Every state is a URL** (answers as query params) — veterans answer
  "which MiSTer?" threads with a link that opens the pre-pruned map.
- `provides_unverified` renders hedged; low-confidence prices render hedged.

## hardware.json schema (v1)

Top-level keys:

- `meta` — `{schema, updated, currency}`. Bump `updated` on every edit.
- `capabilities` — vocabulary of tokens used in `provides`/`requires`.
  `{id: {name, explain}}`. Add a token here before using it anywhere.
- `lanes` — ordered `[{id, name, tagline}]`.
- `parts` — `{id: {name, vendor, price_usd, provides[], requires[], notes,
  verified, sources[]}}`. A part is addable to an option when its `requires`
  tokens are all present in the option's *effective* provides (built-in plus
  included parts, transitively). This is how chains work: an active Y/C
  adapter `requires: [yc-source]`; the analog I/O board `provides: [yc-source]`
  but `requires: [gpio-header]`; boards provide `gpio-header`. The renderer
  computes the closure — parts and options stay independent to edit.
- `options` — the starting points. `[{id, lane, name, vendor, price_usd,
  status, provides[], includes[], to_complete[], notes, verified, sources[]}]`
  - `status`: `orderable | preorder | announced | discontinued | cancelled`.
    "Sells in batches, sold out between them" is `orderable` + a note, not
    a status.
  - `provides`: capability tokens built into the product itself
  - `provides_unverified` (optional): tokens the vendor/press claim but no
    teardown or review confirms. Render visibly hedged, never as plain fact.
  - `includes`: ids physically in the box — part ids OR option ids (kits
    contain boards). Their provides count as built-in; never restate them
    in `provides`.
  - `url`: the official product page, rendered as the "vendor - official
    page" link at the top of the spec sheet. `null` when no stable official
    page exists (QMTech's AliExpress store URL is volatile; announced items
    often have none) - never substitute a review or a reseller.
  - `to_complete`: part ids still needed for a minimal working setup
    (PSU, SD card, controller — and SDRAM for bare boards: a board that
    can't run popular cores is not complete). Complete price = price_usd
    + these. May also name an OPTION id (Ironclad DX needs a whole board).
  - `what` (REQUIRED): one plain-language identity sentence. The first
    thing a newcomer reads on the sheet.
  - `advice` (REQUIRED): the expert's orientation. TONE RULE (user,
    2026-07-16): popularity and fit, never put-downs — "most commonly
    recommended", "the pick if you want X" are the register; no
    pooh-poohing any product or brand. Factual trade-offs allowed.
    May point across lanes ("the kits lane is this stack pre-built").
  - `variants` (optional): first-party configurations,
    `[{id, name, price_delta, adds[], note}]`. Rendered as chain-style
    answers ("Fits with: the Analogue version (+$50)") and a Versions
    line on the sheet. Use when a configuration changes capabilities or
    price meaningfully; NEVER split an option into multiple cards for
    SKU differences (ruling 2026-07-16 — the noob decision is which
    product, not which SKU). Variant tokens beat parts chains in the
    requirement check (buying the right version beats bolting on parts).

Sheet structure (redesigned 2026-07-16 for newcomers — the sheet is an
ONBOARDING view, not a data dump): photo, price, `what`, generated
"To get playing" sentence (from to_complete, plus a CRT-budget line when
Y/C needs parts), `advice`, Versions line, capability chips, then
everything else (research notes, unverified flags, chains, sources,
confidence) behind a collapsed disclosure labeled **"Specs and sources"**
(user rejected "The fine print" — not a contract).

Interview/rail rulings (user, 2026-07-16 overhaul round):
- Verdict + tally render BELOW the questions. Nothing that appears on
  answering may push the questions down - no layout shift above the
  interaction point.
- Questions are flat in the rail (no per-question card boxes).
- Multi-select questions AND single-answer toggles render as literal
  checkboxes (accent-colored native inputs); only mutually-exclusive
  choices are buttons.
- Price display: ONE headline number - the complete price, which includes
  whatever the visitor's answers require. Device/sticker price and
  availability follow muted on one secondary line (availability ranks
  below price but stays visible). Never show "range + from-X-complete"
  side by side.
- Cards explain themselves per answered question: one line per answered
  requirement, labeled with the ANSWER'S OWN WORDS ("S-Video / Composite:
  built in" / "with parts (~$27)" / "with the Analogue version (+$50)" /
  "claimed by vendor, unverified").

Reddit research (WORKING since 2026-07-16): `tools/reddit_search.py` -
official API with the user's own keys from `.secrets/reddit.json` in the
MAIN checkout ({"client_id": "...", "client_secret": ""} - empty secret =
installed-app grant, which is what the user has). NEVER commit or echo the
keys. Usage: `python tools/reddit_search.py "query" [--sub X --limit N
--sort new]` for search, `--comments POST_ID` for a thread. r/MiSTerFPGA
is dense with owner reports - it corrected the SSOne DIN10 story
(Saturn PINOUT, round-plug aftermarket cables fit, OEM keyed shells do
not) on day one. Prefer this over the --headed browser hack.

Field conventions (parts and options both):
  - `price_usd`: number, `[low, high]` range (vendor/batch spread), or
    `null` (= unknown; never guess). EUR-sourced prices are converted
    approximately and say so in notes.
  - `confidence`: `high | medium | low` — high means a vendor/official page
    was fetched directly; medium reviewer-sourced; low snippet/commodity
    estimate. Render low-confidence prices hedged.
- `appendix_not_mister` — `[{name, one_liner, sources[]}]`. The "looks like
  MiSTer, isn't" fence. Keep each to one honest line.

## Card + rail rendering rules (2026-07-17 round, all shipped - do not
## silently reverse)

- **Prices sit at the BOTTOM of every card** in every lane: one scan line
  across the page. Order inside a card: status tag, photo, name, capability
  chips, per-answer lines, RAM reminder, then complete price + muted
  device/availability line.
- **Badges are STICKERS**: absolutely positioned over the card's top-right
  corner, slightly rotated, allowed to overhang, never pushing content
  down. Sticker = accent background, bg-colored text. Two stickers stack
  with alternating tilt. Current set (post-answer only): "cheapest fit"
  (computed), "community favorite" (editorial `popular` flag), and
  "cheap and in stock" - the cheapest among usually-in-stock fits, shown
  only when that differs from the outright cheapest (prototype; user asked
  to see it, has not yet ruled on keeping it).
- **One gray language**: dimmed pcards match the mini grayed cards (dashed
  hairline, page bg, .45 text). colsdim dims only the column headers -
  the cards inside carry their own dim/mini styling.
- **Lane subtitles are user copy** (2026-07-17): Consoles "Plug and play;
  less open ecosystem." / Kits "Standard MiSTer sandwiches, assembled.
  Play today, but easy to tinker and swap parts later." / DIY "Pick a
  mainboard, add what you need, put it together yourself."
- **The rail CTA is visual**: CSS-drawn down-arrows flanking "Your
  requirements here" (the plain-ASCII rule governs copy, not CSS
  decoration).
- **Availability is IMPLIED, never asserted**: all stock copy is an
  impression ("tends to sell out between batches", "usually in stock") and
  the footer tells visitors to check the shop themselves before counting
  on stock.
- **Visitors are assumed to own a USB controller**: no option lists
  usb-controller in to_complete (the part stays as a reference record);
  one footer sentence states the assumption.
- **The shelf answer filters JAMMA gear** (dims mistercade-lite etc.), so
  shelf and cabinet are inverse filters and shelf is a real option.
- **Built-in per-answer lines collapse to one "Covers: X, Y" line**; costed
  paths and overridden lines stay separate.
- **`line_overrides`** (option field): `{token: "text"}` replaces the
  "built in" line for a token the option provides - e.g. the SuperStation
  One's snac override "built in (PS1 ports); others via the SuperDock +
  adapter" (r/MiSTerFPGA 1obnro9 / 1q53mss / 1tjuym2: unit SNAC is
  PS1-ports-only, USB ports carry no SNAC; the dock adds the SNAC port).
  Validator checks the keys are capability tokens.
- **"To get playing" sentences never end "and you are playing"** (the
  prefix already says it); options with an empty to_complete get "Nothing
  else to buy - it plays out of the box."
- **Sheet "Specs and sources" stays COLLAPSED** (user agreed 2026-07-17;
  default-open was considered and dropped).
- RULING: variant-beats-cheaper-chain confirmed for consoles - the buyer
  of a less-open ecosystem wants the ecosystem version, not a dongle
  (MS2 RGB = Analogue version, never a Direct Video dongle).
- Data facts landed 2026-07-17: iCode digital + Analog builds as variants
  (both in stock, SD preloaded 64GB-1TB, 256GB anchors $459.95/$479.95);
  QMTech assembled includes its 32GB card; Multisystem2 ships with NO SD
  card and NO PSU (Heber's own "Extras you will need" list) - both are in
  its to_complete now. RetroCastle box contents (SD? PSU?) still
  unverified - needs the --cdp sweep.

## Chain-honesty rules (overnight audit 2026-07-17)

- **I/O-class parts (category io) only chain onto DIY mainboards.** An
  assembled kit's GPIO stack is occupied; "add a MiSTercade to your Armor
  bundle" would mean gutting the kit, so it renders as no-path, matching
  the sealed products. This resolves the socket-occupancy limitation for
  the io category specifically.
- **Chains leaning on a part that itself sells out say so**: "with parts
  (~$50, sells out)" - driven by the part's optional `stock` field (the
  SuperDock case).
- **The dead-end banner names near-misses that failed only on
  availability** ("Would fit, but sells out between batches: ...") in
  addition to horizon matches.
- The verdict/tally stay retired; only the dead-end banner renders.
- Answers may carry `short` - the compact wording used for card info lines
  and failure reasons; `label` stays the full checkbox/radio text.

## Known modeling limitation (schema v1)

The chain closure treats an included option's sockets as free. In reality a
kit's own board can occupy the GPIO stack (e.g. iCode's digital-I/O build,
MiSTercade), so a "possible with parts" answer for such kits may mean
"replace a board", not "add one". The renderer must phrase with-parts
answers for kit-lane options as advisory. Proper fix if it ever matters:
a `consumes` field on parts/options that removes socket tokens.

After ANY edit to hardware.json, run the validator (JSON parse + token/id
integrity + chain reachability):

    python validate_landscape.py docs/landscape/hardware.json

## Research access

When WebFetch 403s a source (retrorgb.com, misterfpga.org, aliexpress.com
all do), fetch it through a real browser instead:
`python tools/fetch_page.py <url> [needle]` - Playwright Chromium from this
machine's IP, verified working on all three 2026-07-16. Reddit refuses even
this (blocks headless traffic); don't burn time on it. AliExpress shows
CAD prices from this location - convert and date-stamp.

For sites that block even that (RetroCastle): `--cdp` attaches to the
user's OWN desktop Chrome (real profile/fingerprint). COORDINATE FIRST -
the user must launch `chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222`; the tool
opens one tab, reads it, closes only that tab. Built 2026-07-17, not yet
exercised against RetroCastle (waiting on a session where the user starts
Chrome that way).

## Editing recipe for future sessions

1. Read this file fully. 2. Edit `hardware.json` only. 3. New capability?
Define the token in `capabilities` first. 4. Stamp every touched entry's
`verified` with the current YYYY-MM and add a source URL. 5. Bump
`meta.updated`. 6. Normal push policy applies (test locally, user okay).
Visitor-visible landscape changes get a CHANGELOG.md line like everything else.
